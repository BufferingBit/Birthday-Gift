      <p class="poem-line">A soul so bright, you truly stand apart,</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Lifting everyone around with your kind heart.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">In tough times, you rise with so much grace,</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Strength like yours is impossible to replace.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Hope guides your way, even in the fight,</p>
      <p class="poem-line">And love surrounds you, day and night.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Moments like these make me want to say,</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Each day, you inspire me in every way.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Courage is your gift, and kindness your art,</p>
      <p class="poem-line">All that you do shows your beautiful heart.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Remember this always—you’re one of a kind,</p>
      <p class="poem-line">In you, Alisha, the best things combine.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">No matter what struggles come your way,</p>
      <p class="poem-line">Growing stronger, you conquer each day.</p>
      <p class="poem-line">For you, my words can’t fully convey,</p>
      <p class="poem-line">On this belated gift, I just want to say—</p>
      <p class="poem-line">
        You’re cared for and loved more than words display.
